Hi, I am Video Watermark Adder Bot!
**How to Added Watermark to a Video?**
**Usage:** First Send a JPG Image/Logo, then send any Video. Better add watermark to a MP4 or MKV Video.
__Note: I can only process one video at a time. As my server is Heroku, my health is not good. If you have any issues with Adding Watermark to a Video, then please Report at [Support Group](https://t.me/linux_repo).__
